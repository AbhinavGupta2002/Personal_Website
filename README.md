# Personal_Website
This is my personal website, built from scratch using various languages. I coded in Visual Studio software and transferred the files onto Git Hub.
HTML5 and CSS5 have been used to develop this website. I am currently learning Javascript by myself so that I can implement that into my website.

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY A DESKTOP VERSION WEBSITE! (at 100% zoom) (not optimized for mobile)

This self developed website is under the MIT License.

This website is a work in progress and is far from being complete.

Developed by Abhinav Gupta.
